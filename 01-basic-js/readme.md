What is javascript and why we used it ?

-Javascript is logic based programming language where we can create our code project functionality in that.
-Javascipt is a high level programming language for build web pages.
-Now we used the ES6(echma script 6) version of javascript, in other words we called vanilla javascript.
-Runtime environment of javascript is node js.

VARIABLE:

-Variable is container to store some data.
-In javascript we have 3 types of variables-
 1. let:
    -Let is a type of variable is used for changing the variable name later.
    -Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
    -Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the case.  
 2. var:
    -Var is a type of variable which is also used for caging the variable later satge.
    -Var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are dont use var most of the time.
 3. const:
    -Const  is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
    -Const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc... .
